            I was in the military for 4 years but i recently had just gotten out
            a month and a half ago. It was a very challenging experience but
            overall it grew me in ways i never thought were possible. I am
            christian and rely heavily on my faith to navigate through life. I
            have a one year old daughter who loves fruits and knows how to say
            papa. I wish the best for my family and i will continue to work hard
            to achieve success.

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>gym</li>
      <li>basketaball</li>
      <li>walking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I found my passion for these hobbies mostly while i was in the military.
      Often times i got bored so i would head over to the gym located on my base
      and would stay for hours either working out or playing basketball.
      Anything at the time wouldve been ideal because staying on basewith
      nothing to do was torture.
